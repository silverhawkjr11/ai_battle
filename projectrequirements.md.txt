# 🎮 AI Battle — Final Project Specification

*(Clean English version derived from Hebrew source)*


## 📌 Overview

The game is played on a **2D grid map (matrix)** with **two opposing teams**.
Each team is composed of virtual agents with different roles and behaviors.
The goal: **eliminate the enemy team while staying alive.**

You must implement:

* AI behaviors for each agent type
* Navigation and pathfinding
* Team coordination and communication
* A map with obstacles and visibility mechanics
* A graphical representation of all agents and terrain
* Decision-making logic for commanders & soldiers

---

# 🧩 Agent Types

Each team includes the following roles, each represented by a **colored square with a letter inside**:

### **1. Commander (C)**

* Plans team movements and actions.
* Issues **general orders**: *move to position*, *attack*, *defend*.
* Receives status reports from all units.
* Builds a **team visibility map** by combining all soldiers' visibility.
* Can move to safer spots but **cannot attack**.
* If killed: soldiers continue acting independently but **lose access to his visibility map**.

---

### **2. Two Fighters (W)**

* Equipped with an automatic gun + hand grenades.
* Limited ammo & grenades.
* When low on ammo → notify commander → supply soldier gets sent.
* When injured → notify commander → medic gets sent.
* Can fight until health falls below 25% of max.
* Behaviors:

  * **Move Order:** Use A* to reach target, using **safety map** for lowest-risk path.
  * **Attack Order:**

    * Decide from which tile an enemy can be shot or grenaded.
    * A* path to that “attack position.”
    * Shoot/throw grenades as soon as target is in range & line of sight.
  * **Defend Order:**

    * BFS search to find the nearest safe position (unknown a priori).
    * Then A* on safety map to get there.

---

### **3. Medic (M)**

* When ordered, uses A* to:

  1. Go to the **medical supply building**
  2. Then go to the **injured soldier**
* Only medics can restore full health.

---

### **4. Supply Soldier (P)**

* When ordered, uses A* to:

  1. Go to the **ammo storage**
  2. Deliver ammo to the fighters

---

# 🌍 Map Layout & Environment

The map contains various terrain types:

### **● Rocks**

* Cannot be crossed.
* Block bullets.
* Block line-of-sight.
* Create excellent cover positions.

### **● Trees**

* Can walk through.
* Block bullets.
* Block line-of-sight.

### **● Water**

* Cannot walk through.
* Bullets and visibility **do** pass through.

### **● Team Storage Buildings**

* Each team has:

  * Ammo storage
  * Medical storage
* Marked as **yellow squares**

### Obstacles may be randomly scattered or set in fixed locations.

---

# 👁 Visibility System

* Each soldier has his own line-of-sight map.
* Combining all soldiers’ visibility produces the **commander’s visibility map**.
* Some areas remain unseen (behind rocks, out of sight).
* Visibility may be tile-based: if a tile is partially visible, treat it as visible.

---

# 🧠 AI Logic Requirements

## 1. **Pathfinding (A*)**

Used by:

* Fighters (movement, attack positioning)
* Medic (to storage, to injured soldier)
* Supply soldier (to ammo storage, to fighters)

Paths must **minimize risk** using a **safety map**.

---

## 2. **Searching for Unknown Safe Positions (BFS)**

Used by fighters in **defense mode** to:

* Find closest “safe” tile within a search radius.
* After BFS finds the target → use A* to reach it.

---

## 3. **Combat Rules**

* Fighters engage when in shooting or grenade range.
* They may take opportunistic shots even while moving (less effective than attack mode).
* Shooting/grenades must respect line-of-sight rules based on terrain.

---

## 4. **Command Structure**

### Soldiers report:

* Enemy sightings & positions
* Low ammo
* Injuries

### Commander actions:

* Decide whether team should:

  * Attack
  * Defend
  * Redirect supply/medic units
* Build visibility map
* Strategize based on:

  * Enemy location
  * Team health
  * Ammo levels
  * Safe/unsafe zones on map

---

# 🎯 Project Goals

The game must demonstrate:

* Autonomous agent behavior
* Coordinated team strategies
* Decision-making under uncertainty
* Working pathfinding with obstacles
* Line-of-sight visibility simulation
* Proper handling of injuries & supplies
* Real-time movement and combat logic
